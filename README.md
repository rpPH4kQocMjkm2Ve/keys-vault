[![Spec](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fkzys/specs/refs/heads/main/version.json&maxAge=300)](https://github.com/fkzys/specs)

File-based encryption for sensitive directories via [gocryptfs](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs) + GNOME Keyring.

Encrypted ciphertext is stored in a hidden directory; plaintext is mounted via FUSE. The passphrase is stored in GNOME Keyring for automatic unlock.

## Installation

### AUR

```bash
yay -S keys-vault
```

### [gitpkg](https://github.com/fkzys/gitpkg)
```bash
gitpkg install keys-vault
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fkzys/keys-vault.git
cd keys-vault
sudo make install
```
## Configuration

Configuration is read from (in order, later values override earlier):

1. `/etc/keys-vault.conf` — system-wide defaults
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/keys-vault.conf` (default: `~/.config/keys-vault.conf`) — per-user overrides
3. CLI flags (`--dir`, `--cipher-dir`)

### Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PLAIN_DIR` | `~/keys` | Plaintext mount point |
| `CIPHER_DIR` | Derived from `PLAIN_DIR` | Encrypted ciphertext directory |

`CIPHER_DIR` is derived as a hidden directory with `.enc` suffix in the same parent: `~/keys` → `~/.keys.enc`, `~/secure/vault` → `~/secure/.vault.enc`.

## Usage

```bash
keys-vault init       # create vault (random or user-supplied passphrase)
keys-vault open       # mount
keys-vault status     # open / locked / stale / not initialized
keys-vault close      # unmount
keys-vault passwd     # rotate passphrase
```

### Custom directory

```bash
# Via flag
keys-vault --dir=~/secure/credentials init

# Via config
echo 'PLAIN_DIR="${HOME}/secure/credentials"' > ~/.config/keys-vault.conf
keys-vault init
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `init` | Create encrypted volume, store passphrase in keyring |
| `open` | Mount vault; recovers stale mounts; no-op if already mounted or not initialized |
| `close` | Unmount vault; handles stale mounts; no-op if not mounted |
| `status` | Print state: `open` / `locked` / `stale` / `not initialized` |
| `passwd` | Rotate gocryptfs passphrase and update keyring |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dir=PATH` | Plaintext mount point (default: `~/keys`) |
| `--cipher-dir=PATH` | Encrypted ciphertext directory (default: derived from `--dir`) |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show usage |
| `--version` | Show version |

## Systemd integration

A user service is included for automatic mount on login:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now keys-vault.service
```

The service mounts on start (`After=gnome-keyring-daemon.service`) and unmounts on stop.

Custom directories configured via `~/.config/keys-vault.conf` are picked up by the service automatically. For per-flag overrides, create a service drop-in:

```bash
systemctl --user edit keys-vault.service
```

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/keys-vault --dir=%h/secure/credentials open
ExecStop=
ExecStop=/usr/bin/keys-vault --dir=%h/secure/credentials close
```

## Stale mount recovery

If the gocryptfs process dies (e.g. OOM kill) the FUSE mountpoint becomes stale — it appears in `/proc/mounts` but `stat` fails with "Transport endpoint is not connected".

- **`open`** detects this and force-unmounts before re-mounting
- **`close`** detects stale mounts and force-unmounts them
- **`status`** reports `stale` as a distinct state

## Dependencies

- [gocryptfs](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs)
- `secret-tool` (libsecret)
- `fusermount` (fuse2 or fuse3)
- GNOME Keyring (or any Secret Service provider)
